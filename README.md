# The Meetapp

This is a meetup organization app where users can create and subscribe to meetups. Sadly the mobile version is only available for android
since I don't have the resources required to develop on IOS.

## Introduction

Greetings and salutations dear human, welcome to my app. This is the final challenge of the GoStack8 bootcamp. As this is my first fullstack app, there probably is a lot of room for improvement so I'll try to keep this updated as I learn more and more about programming.

### How do I run this?

Just follow the tutorials on these respective directories:

  1 - backend <br />
  2 - web <br />
  3 - mobile <br />
  
#### Notes

I'll be working on a mock API so that you can run the front-end of the web without necessarily running the server.<br />
Integration of tests are on the way! Due to time constraints they weren't added earlier.<br />
If, by some divine intervention, this app actually runs on your machine then enjoy and please try to test every function if you can. I had
fun developing this app and I learned a lot about so many things. <br />
Lastly, `it works on my machine`.

Cheers!
